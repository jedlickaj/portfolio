        Jackson Thomas Jedlicka, aka The Cosmic Columbus is a space explorer, who travels the universe far and wide. He grew up in Rosemount, Minnesota in America, on planet Earth. He furthered his education at UW Madison college (also on Earth), then went on to Stanford. There he studied aerospace engineering and decided to become an astronaut. His timing was incredibly fortunate, for when he became an astronaut, NASA had finished the exo-space rocketship - Zeus. He was the best candidate, and they sent him off on his mission- code name Mayflower. His mission: travel the universe, collect data, and report back to Earth. He has been on his mission for 20 years.
