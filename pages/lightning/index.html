    Lightning!
    
    <div class="design">
        The extremely rare Cosmic Seahorse can be found roaming on the edge of the known universe. Few know of it, and even fewer have seen it. It makes it's home in black holes, which is part of the reason as to why they are seldom seen. They feast on dwarf stars, and have been known to create worm holes.
