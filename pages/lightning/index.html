        This computer science project was crafted by using lines with varying x and y line segments pieced together. This bettle between Electro and Spiderman is one that will never end. It is a war between an unstoppable force and an immovable object.

        As seen in this animation, Spiderman is being zapped by Electro. Every second the lightning is switched on by a timer, is on for another second, then is switched off. Spiderman has great endurance and will not be defeated.
